# E-Commerce Profitability Analysis (Excel)

This project analyzes the profitability and operational efficiency of an e-commerce business using Excel. The analysis covers profit margins, discount impact, returns, and delivery efficiency, leading to data-driven business recommendations.

## Objective
To identify key factors influencing profitability across regions, customer segments, and product categories, and to recommend actions for margin improvement and operational efficiency.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – Pivot Tables, Charts, Data Analysis, Correlation
- PDF Report – Business recommendations and insights summary

## Key Insights
- Top Segment: EMEA Enterprise recorded the highest average profit margin (~23.9%).  
- Returns Impact: High return rates (~46–52%) across regions are the primary cause of profit erosion.  
- Discounts: Weak negative correlation between discount % and profitability (-0.09). Heavy discounts lower per-order profits.  
- Operational Efficiency: Delivery times are similar (~10–11 days), with negligible correlation to profit margins.  
- Pareto Analysis: Top 2–3 subcategories in each category generate ~77–79% of total profit.  

## Business Recommendations
1. Focus premium offerings and marketing on EMEA and APAC Enterprise segments.  
2. Implement initiatives to reduce product returns through improved descriptions and QC.  
3. Apply targeted discounts instead of sitewide promotions.  
4. Prioritize delivery reliability over speed to reduce damages.  
5. Optimize inventory and promotions around top-performing subcategories.
